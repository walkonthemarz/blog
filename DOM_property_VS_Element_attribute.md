#### DOM property VS Element attribute
* Attributes initialize DOM properties and then they are done. Property values can change; attribute values can't.
* Adding and removing the disabled attribute disables and enables the button. The value of the attribute is irrelevant, which is why you cannot enable a button by writing ```<button disabled="false">Still Disabled</button>```.
